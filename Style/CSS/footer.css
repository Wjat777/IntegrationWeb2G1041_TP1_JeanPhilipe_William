BEM – meaning block, element, modifier – is a front-end naming methodology thought up by the guys at Yandex. 
It is a smart way of naming your CSS classes to give them more transparency and meaning to other developers.
They are far more strict and informative, which makes the BEM naming convention ideal for teams 
of developers on larger projects that might last a while.
